# SECNN
Squeeze and Excitation  convolutional neural network implementation
## Requirement
- tensorflow



## Useage
1. Unzip'AHU_data' to get AHU data set
2. Run `secnn_ahu_5cv.py` to training models. 
2. Unzip'chiller_data' to get the Chiller data set
3. Run `secnn_level1.py` to training models. 
4. Run `secnn_level2.py` to training models. 
5. Run `secnn_level3.py` to training models. 
6. Run `secnn_level4.py` to training models. 

## Datasets
- Chiller data were collected by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) project RP-1043.
- AHU data are from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) project RP-1312.
